 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE 
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY

 pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, 
 arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, 
 or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or 
 any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted 
 including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that 
 a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation 
 for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
 Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of 
 the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be 
 considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
 "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as 
 encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, 
 or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) 
 below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their 
 contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is 
 included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other 
 contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in 
 themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work 
 that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as 
 defined below) for the purposes of this License.

 http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by 
 Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,

 have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this 
 License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of 
 works made available under that license under this License or a Creative 
 Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this 
 License.
 .
 "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and 
 copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other 
 transfer of ownership.

 and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or 
 otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;

 this License including without limitation any production in the literary, 
 scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its 
 expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other 
 writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a 
 dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment 
 in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a 
 cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a 
 process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, 
 architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to 
 which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to 
 photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or 
 three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or 
 science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data 
 to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work 
 performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not 
 otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 .
 "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License 
 who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to 
 the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to 
 exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to 
 communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or 
 process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital 
 performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that 
 members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place 
 individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any 
 means or process and the communication to the public of the performances 
 of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and 
 rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
 "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including 
 without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of 
 fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a 
 protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic 
 medium.

 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from 
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the 
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, 
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to 
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
 .
 to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, 
 including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to 
 clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to 
 the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The 
 original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification 
 could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in 
 Collections; and,
 .
 to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which 
 the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory 
 licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive 
 right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights 
 granted under this License;
 .
 Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the 
 right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing 
 scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect 
 such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this 
 License; and,
 .
 Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect 
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a 
 member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing 
 schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted 
 under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now 
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make 
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in 
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not 
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of 
 this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource 
 Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You 
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
 the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the 
 recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient 
 under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must 
 keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer 
 of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly 
 Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not 
 impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the 
 ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights 
 granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 
 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does 
 not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject 
 to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice 
 from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the 
 Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You 
 create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
 extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by 
 Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
 You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms 
 of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same 
 License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction 
 license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same 
 License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); 
 (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation 
 under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the 
 terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of 
 any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable 
 License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License 
 generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, 
 or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation 
 You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any 
 terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License 
 or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights 
 granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; 
 (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable 
 License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work 
 as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) 
 when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not 
 impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that 
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to 
 exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the 
 Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as 
 incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection 
 apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the 
 Applicable License.
 .
 If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or 
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 
 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, 
 reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the 
 Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the 
 Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., 
 a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution 
 ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service 
 or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the 
 title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably 
 practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated 
 with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or 
 licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 
 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the 
 Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original 
 Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The 
 credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable 
 manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or 
 Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all 
 contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as 
 part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the 
 credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, 
 You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of 
 attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights 
 under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply 
 any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, 
 Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use 
 of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of 
 the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be 
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or 
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations 
 or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
 derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to 
 the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those 
 jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in 
 Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be 
 deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory 
 action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the 
 Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the 
 fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to 
 reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right 
 to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY 
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, 
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, 
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF 
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE 
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR 
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS 
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. 
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from 
 You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated 
 provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with 
 those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any 
 termination of this License.
 .
 Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the 
 Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at 
 any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to 
 withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
 to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will 
 continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, 
 the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same 
 terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor 
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms 
 and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
 remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the 
 parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the 
 minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
 consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed 
 by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, 
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified 
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may 
 appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified 
 without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
 The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention 
 for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on 
 September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright 
 Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and 
 the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These 
 rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in 
 which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the 
 corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions 
 in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted 
 under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted 
 under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in 
 the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any 
 rights under applicable law.
